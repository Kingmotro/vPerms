vPerms
==

A permissions plugin aiming to support multiple inheritance, proper multiserver support (instant permissions propagation
without risk of overwrites), and sufficient features for the typical server network use case.

Current todo
--
* Commands
* Player permissions storage (each player has their own effective group model)
* Code up permissions/group updating
* Actually generate and apply PermissionAttachments
* Separate Bukkit stuff into separate module
* Look into more efficient storage
* Implement VaultAPI basics
